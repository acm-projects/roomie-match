/*
This class will be used to hold a user's profile information. For example, when a match is found,
their user data is pulled from Firebase and stored in a Profile object. The profile object does not
include all of the data that needs to be stored in Firestore, as things such as the UID do not need
to be dislayed to other users when there is a match or potential match.
